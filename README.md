1. Consider a combined gas-steam power plant that has a net power output of 28 MW. The pressure ratio of the gas turbine cycle is 11. Air enters the compressor at 300 K and the turbine at 1100 K. The combustion gases leaving the gas turbine are used to heat the steam at 5 MPa to 350°C in a heat exchanger. The combustion gases leave the heat exchanger at 420K. An open feedwater heater incorporated with the steam cycle operates at a pressure of 0.8 MPa. The condenser pressure is 10 KPa. Assuming isentropic efficiencies of 100% for the pump, 82% for the compressor, and 86% for the gas and steam turbines, determine: (a) the mass flow rate ratio of air to steam, (b) the required rate of heat input in the combustion chamber, and (c) the thermal efficiency of the combined cycle.
2. Consider a combined gas-steam power cycle. The topping cycle is a simple Brayton cycle that has a pressure ratio of 7. Air enters the compressor at 15°C at a rate of 10kg/s and the gas turbine at 950°C. The bottoming cycle is a reheat Rankine cycle between the pressure limits of 6 MPa and 10 kPa. Steam is heated in a heat exchanger at a rate of 1.15 kg/s by the exhaust gases leaving the gas turbine, and the exhaust gases leave the heat exchanger at 200°C. Steam leaves the high-pressure turbine at 1.0 MPa and is reheated to 400°C in the heat excha代 写MAE 115 APPLIED ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS Hw#5Python

Assuming 8’% isentropic efficiency for all pumps and turbines, determine (a) the moisture content at the exit of the low-pressure turbine, (b) the steam temperature at the inlet of the high-pressure turbine, (c) the net power output and the thermal efficiency of the combined plant.

3. Consider a cogeneration plant for which the utilization factor is 0.5. Can the exergy destruction associated with this plant be zero? If yes, under what conditions?
4. Consider a cogeneration power plant modified with regeneration. Steam enters the turbine at 9 MPa and 400°C and expands to a pressure of 1.6 MPa. At this pressure, 35% of the steam is extracted from the turbine, and the remainder expands to 10 kPa. Part of the extracted steam is used to heat the feedwater in an open feedwater heater. The rest of the extracted steam is used for process heating and leaves the process heater as a saturated liquid at 1.6 MPa. It is subsequently mixed with the feedwater leaving the feedwater heater, and the mixture is pumped to the boiler pressure. Assuming the turbines and the pumps to be isentropic, show the cycle on a T-s diagram with respect to saturation lines, and determine the mass flow rate of steam through the boiler for a net power output of 25 MW.
